qgis-testing-environment
================================

This is a simple container for testing QGIS Desktop and for
executing unit tests inside a real QGIS instance.

# Features

The image contains QGIS 2.14 official build installed from debian GIS
repositories and a python script to run unit tests inside QGIS.

You can use this docker to test QGIS or to run unit tests inside QGIS,
xvfb is available and running as a service inside the container to allow
for fully automated headless testing in Travis CI jobs.


# Building

You can build the image with:

```
# Place your IP address here, if you want to use apt-catcher note that APT
# catcher is not enabled by default, in order to enable it, you should
# uncomment two lines in the docker file (see comments in Dockerfile).
$ export ADDR=192.168.1.1
$ docker build -t qgis-testing-environment --build-arg APT_CATCHER_IP=$ADDR .
```

# Running QGIS

To run a container, assuming that you want to use your current display to use
QGIS and the image is named `qgis-testing-environment`:

```
# Allow connections from any host
$ xhost +
$ docker run --rm  -it --name qgis_desktop-testing-environment -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  \
    -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY qgis-testing-environment qgis
```

# Running unit tests inside QGIS

Suppose that you have local directory containing the tests to execute into
QGIS:

```
/my_tests/travis_tests/
├── faketest.py
├── __init__.py
├── tclass.py
└── test_TravisTest.py
```

To run the tests inside the container, you have to mount the directory that
contains the tests (e.g. your local directory `/my_tests`) into a volume
that is accessible by the container.


```
$ docker run -d --name qgis-testing-environment -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v /my_tests/:/tests_directory -e DISPLAY=:99 qgis-desktop

```

When done, you can invoke the test runnner (output follows, the failure is
expected):

```
$ docker exec -it qgis-testing-environment sh -c "qgis_testrunner.sh travis_tests.test_TravisTest.run_fail"

## Options for the test runner

The env var `QGIS_EXTRA_OPTIONS` defaults to an empty string and can
contains extra parameters that are passed to QGIS by the test runner.


# Implementation notes

The main goal of this image was to execute unit tests inside a real instance
of QGIS (not a mocked one).

The QGIS tests should be runnable from a Travis CI job.

The implementation is:

- run the docker, mounting as volumes the unit tests folder in `/tests_directory`
    (or the QGIS plugin   folder if the unit tests belong to a plugin and the
    plugin is needed to run the tests)
- execute `qgis_setup.sh MyPluginName` script in docker that sets up QGIS to
  avoid blocking modal dialogs  and installs the plugin into QGIS if needed
    - create config and python plugin folders for QGIS
    - disable tooltips in the `QGIS2.conf` file
    - enable the plugin  in the `QGIS2.conf` file
    - install the `startup.py` script to disable python exception modal dialogs
- execute the tests by running `qgis_testrunner.sh MyPluginName.tests.tests_MyTestModule.run_my_tests_function`
- the output of the tests is captured by the `test_runner.sh` script and
  searched for `FAILED` (that is in the standard unit tests output), if
  that string is present in the output, the script exists with `1` else
  it exits with `0`.

`qgis_testrunner.sh` accepts a dotted notation path to the test module that
can end with the function that has to be called inside the module to run the
tests. The last part (`.run_my_tests_function`) can be omitted and defaults to
`run_all`.


# Running in Travis

This is a simple use case for running unit tests of a small QGIS plugin:

```
services:
    - docker
before_install:
    # Build this docker:
    # - cd qgis-testing-environment && docker build -t qgis-testing-environment .
    # or just pull it:
    - docker pull elpaso/qgis-testing-environment:latest
install:
    - docker run -d --name qgis-testing-environment -v ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}:/tests_directory -e DISPLAY=:99 qgis-testing-environment
    - sleep 10
    # Setup qgis and enable the plugin
    - docker exec -it qgis-testing-environment sh -c "qgis_setup.sh QuickWKT"
    # If needd additional steps (for example make or paver setup, place it here)
    # Link the plugin to the tests_directory
    - docker exec -it qgis-testing-environment sh -c "ln -s /tests_directory /root/.qgis2/python/plugins/QuickWKT"

script:
    - docker exec -it qgis-testing-environment sh -c "qgis_testrunner.sh QuickWKT.tests.test_Plugin"
```
